<br>
The hashing function uses folding methodology. Write an application to allow people to use the table. Requirements: 1.The inputs to the table are strings. Each string is the key to itself 2.The length of the table is given by the user.(ask for the table length at the beginning of the program) 3.The hashing: A) Convert the key to an integer by using hashCode() in string class B) Cut the integer obtained in step A to segments by using folding method. Group the digits based on the size of the table C) Sum the segment. The result will be used as an index i 4.Use the linear probing strategy to solve the collision problem. 5.The program allows the user to insert, search and delete the contents in the table.
